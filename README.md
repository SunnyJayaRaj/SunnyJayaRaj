### 🌱 About Me

Not a developer (yet!) — but I’ve brushed up against tech before and now I’m diving deeper into it.  
This space is where I document my beginner journey, share small wins, and grow one commit at a time.

### 💡 What I’m Up To

- Exploring Git, GitHub & all things open source  
- Taking notes in my [📘 curious-explorer](https://github.com/SunnyJayaRaj/curious-explorer) repo  
- Making sense of things by writing them down
